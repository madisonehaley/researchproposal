      <h1>Background/Review of Literature</h1>
         <p>Several studies have been conducted on the beneficial effects of nature exposure in prisons. Such studies have found that “Prisoner
          Exposure to Nature (PEN)” can improve the physical and mental health of inmates on a level comparative to that of healthcare facilities
          (Reddon et al.) (Moran et al.). Further, “prisons with a higher proportion of the area within their perimeter given over to natural 
          vegetation exhibit lower levels of self-harm and violence (both between prisoners and toward staff)” (Moran et al.). Some studies focus
          on ‘green’ prison programs, involving tasks like gardening and animal stewardship, which have shown to both reduce recidivism rates and
          improve mental health of participating inmates (Van Der Linden) (Nadkarni et al.). Although all of these studies are crucial for gaining
          insight into the impacts that nature exposure poses on incarcerated individuals’ mental health and behavior, no studies exist that dive
          deeper into the ways in which a lack of exposure to nature influences inmates’ ideas surrounding it. This is the question I’d like to
          focus my research on.</p>
