 <h1>Research Proposal</h1>
    <h2> Introduction</h2>
      <p>Ecological worldviews, or the ways an individual defines nature and views humanity’s role in ecological systems on earth,
        directly inform how one behaves in relation to the non-human external environment. In a world facing increasingly deadly 
        climate disasters, species extinction, and ecological collapse, it’s essential to understand the mechanisms that influence 
        one’s treatment and beliefs about the natural world in order to combat our collective violence against it. Seemingly unrelated, 
        mass incarceration in the United States is a topic justly facing scrutiny for a number of reasons; however, there is little 
        understanding about the personal ecological worldviews of those experiencing long-term incarceration. More research is needed 
        to understand the specific psychological impacts that result from being in a nature-deprived community of incarcerated individuals
        for long periods of time. My research will serve to explore these impacts and how they work to shape imprisoned 
        people’s ecological worldviews.</p>
      <p>My half-brother Kristjan is currently incarcerated, serving his 17th year of a 20 year sentence in Arizona State Prison Complex
        (ASPC). During this time, he’s moved from yards of various security levels, each with their own distinct rules and cultures. 
        Inmates in medium-security yards get more access - about 3 times weekly for 2 hours at a time - to the “rec” area: a concrete
        basketball court, exercise area, and dirt to walk around on, all fenced in by a barbed-wire cage and surveilled by guards. The view
        through the fence is barren desert with extremely limited amounts of vegetation. Contrast that to super-max security, in which inmates
        are allowed only 1 hour per week outdoors, where they are escorted outside of their cells in cuffs to stand in a cage with only the sky
        visible. Finally, solitary isolation includes zero access to any space outside of the individual’s cell. Kris often talks about feeling
        like an animal because the way that he’s treated is far from humane. As an environmental studies major, my academic interest in ecology
        intersects with my personal connection to incarcerated individuals through my work in this research project.</p>
