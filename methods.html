      <h1>Methods</h1>
        <p>In order to gain an understanding of the impacts that incarceration has on the ecological worldviews of imprisoned individuals, I will
          collect data from at least 25 individuals experiencing incarceration at Arizona State Prison Complex Lewis (ASPC). Data collection will
          consist of in-depth phone interviews with the participants, considering in-person visitation access is highly limited due to the COVID-19
          pandemic. The interview questions will consist of broad, psychologically-based questions such as “how do you define nature?,” “how does
          being in prison impact your view of the natural world?,” “how do you believe yourself and your fellow inmates might behave differently if
          they had access to nature, like a forest?”. I will also ask more concrete questions such as “what do you see when you look outside your
          cell window?,” “how much access to the outdoors do you get weekly?”. I will record each phone conversation and create transcripts of the
          interviews. I will analyze the transcript data by coding for significant statements regarding key topics including prison, prison psychology,
          ecology, ecological worldviews, nature, etc. These significant data points and themes will then inform my written description of the
          participants’ experiences. Along with interviews, I will collect multimodal data in the form of images of the landscape surrounding ASPC.
          If possible, I will collect images sourced online of ASPC prison cells and common areas. I will visually analyze these images and draw
          conclusions based on the presence, or lack thereof, of natural vegetative green spaces.</p>
