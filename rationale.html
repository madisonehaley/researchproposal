      <h1>Rationale</h1>
        <p>Specifically, the question that I will be exploring is as follows: How does long-term incarceration in a nature-deprived environment
          influence a person’s ecological worldview? Because ecological worldviews are so complex, the specificities and nuances of worldviews
          shaped by incarceration may vary among impacted individuals. However, in general, I hypothesize that living in a prison with no direct
          access to or view of nature - specifically in a desert environment - will breed nihilism in an individual, resulting in an ecological
          worldview where humans exist as the dominant species, separated from the natural world, with a tendency towards violence against its
          systems. If my hypothesis is confirmed, it proves that prisons are set up in a way to breed negative relationships between humans and
          nature. If my hypothesis is not confirmed, then there may be too many factors, including upbringing and cultural differences, influencing
          participants’ ecological worldviews than can be explained by incarceration alone</p>
