      <h1>Research Proposal</h1>
    <h2> Introduction</h2>
      <p>Ecological worldviews, or the ways an individual defines nature and views humanity’s role in ecological systems on earth,
        directly inform how one behaves in relation to the non-human external environment. In a world facing increasingly deadly 
        climate disasters, species extinction, and ecological collapse, it’s essential to understand the mechanisms that influence 
        one’s treatment and beliefs about the natural world in order to combat our collective violence against it. Seemingly unrelated, 
        mass incarceration in the United States is a topic justly facing scrutiny for a number of reasons; however, there is little 
        understanding about the personal ecological worldviews of those experiencing long-term incarceration. More research is needed 
        to understand the specific psychological impacts that result from being in a nature-deprived community of incarcerated individuals
        for long periods of time. My research will serve to explore these impacts and how they work to shape imprisoned 
        people’s ecological worldviews.</p>
      <p>My half-brother Kristjan is currently incarcerated, serving his 17th year of a 20 year sentence in Arizona State Prison Complex
        (ASPC). During this time, he’s moved from yards of various security levels, each with their own distinct rules and cultures. 
        Inmates in medium-security yards get more access - about 3 times weekly for 2 hours at a time - to the “rec” area: a concrete
        basketball court, exercise area, and dirt to walk around on, all fenced in by a barbed-wire cage and surveilled by guards. The view
        through the fence is barren desert with extremely limited amounts of vegetation. Contrast that to super-max security, in which inmates
        are allowed only 1 hour per week outdoors, where they are escorted outside of their cells in cuffs to stand in a cage with only the sky
        visible. Finally, solitary isolation includes zero access to any space outside of the individual’s cell. Kris often talks about feeling
        like an animal because the way that he’s treated is far from humane. As an environmental studies major, my academic interest in ecology
        intersects with my personal connection to incarcerated individuals through my work in this research project.</p>
      <h2>Background/Review of Literature</h3>
        <p>Several studies have been conducted on the beneficial effects of nature exposure in prisons. Such studies have found that “Prisoner
          Exposure to Nature (PEN)” can improve the physical and mental health of inmates on a level comparative to that of healthcare facilities
          (Reddon et al.) (Moran et al.). Further, “prisons with a higher proportion of the area within their perimeter given over to natural 
          vegetation exhibit lower levels of self-harm and violence (both between prisoners and toward staff)” (Moran et al.). Some studies focus
          on ‘green’ prison programs, involving tasks like gardening and animal stewardship, which have shown to both reduce recidivism rates and
          improve mental health of participating inmates (Van Der Linden) (Nadkarni et al.). Although all of these studies are crucial for gaining
          insight into the impacts that nature exposure poses on incarcerated individuals’ mental health and behavior, no studies exist that dive
          deeper into the ways in which a lack of exposure to nature influences inmates’ ideas surrounding it. This is the question I’d like to
          focus my research on.</p>
      <h2>Rationale</h2>
        <p>Specifically, the question that I will be exploring is as follows: How does long-term incarceration in a nature-deprived environment
          influence a person’s ecological worldview? Because ecological worldviews are so complex, the specificities and nuances of worldviews
          shaped by incarceration may vary among impacted individuals. However, in general, I hypothesize that living in a prison with no direct
          access to or view of nature - specifically in a desert environment - will breed nihilism in an individual, resulting in an ecological
          worldview where humans exist as the dominant species, separated from the natural world, with a tendency towards violence against its
          systems. If my hypothesis is confirmed, it proves that prisons are set up in a way to breed negative relationships between humans and
          nature. If my hypothesis is not confirmed, then there may be too many factors, including upbringing and cultural differences, influencing
          participants’ ecological worldviews than can be explained by incarceration alone</p>
      <h2>Methods</h2>
        <p>In order to gain an understanding of the impacts that incarceration has on the ecological worldviews of imprisoned individuals, I will
          collect data from at least 25 individuals experiencing incarceration at Arizona State Prison Complex Lewis (ASPC). Data collection will
          consist of in-depth phone interviews with the participants, considering in-person visitation access is highly limited due to the COVID-19
          pandemic. The interview questions will consist of broad, psychologically-based questions such as “how do you define nature?,” “how does
          being in prison impact your view of the natural world?,” “how do you believe yourself and your fellow inmates might behave differently if
          they had access to nature, like a forest?”. I will also ask more concrete questions such as “what do you see when you look outside your
          cell window?,” “how much access to the outdoors do you get weekly?”. I will record each phone conversation and create transcripts of the
          interviews. I will analyze the transcript data by coding for significant statements regarding key topics including prison, prison psychology,
          ecology, ecological worldviews, nature, etc. These significant data points and themes will then inform my written description of the
          participants’ experiences. Along with interviews, I will collect multimodal data in the form of images of the landscape surrounding ASPC.
          If possible, I will collect images sourced online of ASPC prison cells and common areas. I will visually analyze these images and draw
          conclusions based on the presence, or lack thereof, of natural vegetative green spaces.</p>
